This repository serves as a guide for developers to understand and implement unit tests and integration tests for a basic Spring Boot application. The goal is to provide step-by-step instructions and examples to facilitate the testing process.

== Getting Started

To begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later
- Maven
- Git

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

== Instructions

=== 1. Setting Up the Project

- Ensure you have the necessary dependencies added to your `pom.xml` for testing frameworks such as JUnit, Mockito, etc.

=== 2. Writing Unit Tests

- Navigate to the `src/test/java/com/example/demo/unit/` directory.
- Create new Java classes for unit tests following naming conventions like `ClassNameTest`.
- Utilize JUnit and Mockito (if needed) to write unit tests for individual components or methods.

=== 3. Creating Integration Tests

- Move to the `src/test/java/com/example/demo/integration/` directory.
- Develop Java classes for integration tests targeting the interaction between multiple components or modules.
- Use appropriate testing techniques to validate interactions and behaviors across these components.

=== 4. Running Tests

- Execute tests using your build tool (Maven or Gradle) from the terminal:
  
```bash
mvn test
```

=== 5. Continuous Integration (CI)

- Integrate these tests into your Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automate testing on code changes.
